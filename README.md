# jCurry (curry.js)

We've all heard it, "If you add jQuery to your resume, don't expect an interview". I'm here to change that, adding jCurry to your resume, not matter the job application, guarantees you the CEO position. Trust me.

Another small project to help me learn and also keep me from playing too much videogames. This jQuery inspired library aims to create a simple, barebones and from scratch implementation of jQuery without checking its source code. What a challenge right?!

## Install

If you want to try this out, it's really simple. Just like with jQuery, import the `curry.js` in the `<head>` element and add your own scripts file in the `<footer>` element.

DISCLAIMER: This is important as the library scans the DOM, which is not generated yet when the library is imported. Therefore you must include your script AFTER the whole DOM tree.

### Last Words

This is a hobby project but I am a perfectionist so I am aiming to develop this as long as it's fun and fits my capabilities. Issues, pull requests, suggestions and comments are encouraged and would help me out!
